METHODOLOGY:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The repurposing score is computed as a weighted combination of:
  1. Symptom Similarity (60%): Diseases with overlapping clinical presentations
  2. Gene Bridge Support (20%): Shared genetic/molecular basis (from ClinVar)
  3. Symptom Signature Overlap (20%): Direct phenotype matching (from PubMed)

A disease pair with HIGH score indicates:
  - Similar symptom profiles (common clinical presentation)
  - Shared underlying genetic factors
  - Overlapping molecular pathways
  - Strong potential for drug repurposing

IMPLICATIONS:
  - Drugs effective for Disease A may be repurposable for Disease B
  - Clinical trials can be prioritized by evidence strength
  - Mechanistic validation is recommended via PPI/gene analysis
  - Multi-layer evidence (genes + symptoms) increases confidence
